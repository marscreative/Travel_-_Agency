        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Gracious Angeli Travel and Tours is a company with great potential for higher growth and development. Founded in June 1999 and having achieved high standards of development in the tourism industry, it can truly be described as one of the leading travel agencies in the Luzon area. Ms. Judith Balisong Balabag, the general manager and owner of the company, was in charge of the operation for twenty-four (24) years. With these 24 years, she has garnered a lot of working experience to enable her to succeed in her endeavor. When the pandemic ravaged the globe, she has been working on her own and has been able to penetrate into certain fora and platform in this business which she was never aware of, and which are great for this company now.
